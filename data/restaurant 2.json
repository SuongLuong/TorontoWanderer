    "description": "Originally used as a Swedish verb meaning “to go out for coffee,” the word fika can also be used as a noun: “coffee break”. It is standard in Sweden to invite friends to fika every few hours during the work day. One’s coffee is normally accompanied with a small snack such as a cinnamon bun or a piece of cake. Our logo is represented by the Dala horse, which is a symbol of Sweden. Fika Café provides a cozy place in Toronto for people to come and break away from the ordinary with exceptional coffees, teas and housemade pastries, served by one of our welcoming baristas.",
