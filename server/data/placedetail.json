    "description": "Toronto's iconic CN Tower, a communications spire and a marvel of 1970s engineering, looks like a giant concrete hypodermic needle. Riding one of the glass elevators up what was once the world's highest freestanding structure (553m) is one of those things you just have to do in Toronto. Even if you don't, you're bound to catch a glimpse of the tower at night: the entire structure puts on a brilliant (free) light show year-round.",

    "description": "Opened in 1914, the multidisciplinary ROM is Canada's biggest natural-history museum and one of the largest museums in North America. You'll either love or loathe the synergy between the original heritage buildings at the main entrance on Bloor St and the 2007 addition of 'the Crystal,' which appears to pierce the original structure and juts out into the street like a massive shard. There are free docent-led tours daily.",

    "description": "Centered on the 1832 Gooderham and Worts distillery – once the British Empire's largest – the 5-hectare Distillery District is one of Toronto's best downtown attractions. Its Victorian industrial warehouses have been converted into soaring galleries, artists studios, design boutiques, cafes and eateries. On weekends newlyweds pose before a backdrop of red brick and cobblestone, young families walk their dogs and the fashionable shop for art beneath charmingly decrepit gables and gantries. In summer expect live jazz, activities, exhibitions and foodie events.",

Several nature walks, workshops and talks are organized by the Nature Centre (https://highparknaturecentre.com) and led by rangers. Shakespeare in High Park has been produced in the park's amphitheater for almost 40 years.",
